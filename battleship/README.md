Hello, here is a code for battleships game, currently in development. 
Final goal features:
- one player and two player modes
- 2 board game interface build: first board with current players shots and hits and second board with also current players ships but with enemy shots and hits marked with them
- custom board size and custom boat count (with impemented limits of course)
- user friendly features, such us secret exit word or easy-to-set game mechanic
- colored game board
- sounds

currently only comments are in polish, but a code itself is wrote in english (i hope it's not-so-hard to understand ^^)
